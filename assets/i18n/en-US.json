      "description": "Simple app made in a course project of robot building. It was created in order to control the robot remotely with bluetooth.\n\nIt has two modes available :\n- Manual control mode : allow to give movement order to the robot with the computer's keyboard, these commands are recorded to be used in the second mode\n- Playback mode : take a previous command recording and reproduce the same sequence.\n\nBluetooth has been used to compensate the lack of electronical supplies, allowing to store data on the computer instead of hard-coding the sequence every time. Recording data was the adopted solution because of the irregularity of the ground and the unability to make proper position control with the given supplies."
